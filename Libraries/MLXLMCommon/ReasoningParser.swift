// MARK: - ReasoningParser

/// Streaming-safe parser that splits a token-by-token model stream into
/// `.content(...)` and `.reasoning(...)` segments based on tag delimiters.
///
/// **Why this lives in vmlx-swift-lm rather than osaurus:**
/// Models like Qwen 3.5/3.6, DeepSeek-R1, and others mark reasoning blocks
/// with literal vocabulary tokens (e.g. `<think>` / `</think>`) that they
/// have **deliberately marked as `special: false`** in their tokenizer config,
/// so every consumer (osaurus, llm-tool, anything else built on
/// vmlx-swift-lm) sees them as plain text. Each consumer would otherwise
/// re-implement the same boundary tracking — and get edge cases wrong.
/// Centralising it here keeps streaming behaviour consistent and lets
/// consumers choose to either show, hide, or relabel reasoning.
///
/// Default tags match Qwen 3.5 / Qwen 3.6 / DeepSeek-R1 (`<think>...</think>`).
/// Override `startTag`/`endTag` for models that use different markers.
///
/// ## Streaming contract
///
/// Token streams arrive in fragments — a single tag may be split across
/// several `feed(...)` calls (e.g. `<thi`, `nk>`). The parser buffers
/// **only** the portion that could be a partial tag prefix; everything
/// else is emitted immediately as `.content` or `.reasoning`.
///
/// On end-of-sequence, call `flush()` once to drain any remaining buffered
/// text. Anything still buffered after a final `flush()` is emitted as
/// `.content` (we never lose tokens to the parser).
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// var parser = ReasoningParser()  // defaults to <think>/</think>
/// for chunk in stream {
///     for segment in parser.feed(chunk) {
///         switch segment {
///         case .content(let text):   appendToVisibleAnswer(text)
///         case .reasoning(let text): appendToThinkPane(text)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// for segment in parser.flush() { ... }
