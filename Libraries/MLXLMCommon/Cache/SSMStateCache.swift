///
/// SSM state is cumulative (path-dependent) and cannot be reconstructed
/// from KV cache alone, so it must be cached separately. Entries are keyed
/// by a SHA-256 hash of the token prefix up to a given boundary, and the
/// cache uses LRU eviction when the entry limit is reached.
///
/// All public methods are thread-safe via `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`.

/// copies of the stored state arrays because model forward passes modify
/// SSM state in-place; sharing would corrupt the cached snapshot.
