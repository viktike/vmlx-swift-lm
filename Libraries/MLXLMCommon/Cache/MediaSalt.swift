// Media salt: a stable fingerprint of VLM image/video inputs for cache keying.
//
// Problem
// -------
// The multi-tier cache coordinator keys its lookups by the flat text token list.
// For VLMs, the model replaces placeholder `<image>` tokens with the vision
// tower's output embeddings during forward pass — so the same token prefix
// with a different image produces different KV state. Naive text-only keying
// would yield false-positive cache hits with the wrong KV for image positions,
// which is why `TokenIterator.init` historically bypassed the cache entirely
// whenever `input.image != nil || input.video != nil`.
//
// Bypassing the cache is extremely expensive: every turn of a multi-turn VLM
// chat re-runs the full vision tower AND re-prefills every prior text token,
// even though neither has changed. On Gemma 4 VLM at 2K context that's
// hundreds of milliseconds to seconds of wasted work per turn.
//
// Fix
// ---
// Compute a SHA256 fingerprint of the raw pixel bytes + shape + dtype of any
// image/video input, and pass it alongside the token list to the cache tiers.
// Each tier mixes the salt into its internal hash (same way modelKey is
// mixed), so "same text prefix + same image" cache-hits while "same text +
// different image" misses, as required.
//
// The salt is computed once per TokenIterator init, stored on the iterator,
// and reused at store time. Cost: one SHA256 pass over the pixel tensor
// (~a few milliseconds for a typical 448x448 image), negligible vs vision
// tower forward (~100 ms).
