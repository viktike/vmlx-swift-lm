/// Streaming text-level stop-sequence matcher.
///
/// Sits at the tail of the generation pipeline, after `ReasoningParser`
/// (which emits `.reasoning` events) and `ToolCallProcessor` (which
/// emits `.toolCall`). Matches against the user-visible `.chunk` text
/// only — reasoning and tool-call bytes are scoped separately per the
/// `Generation` contract.
///
/// ## Algorithm
///
/// Keeps a rolling tail buffer of size `maxStopLen - 1` where
/// `maxStopLen` is the longest configured stop string. On each `feed`,
/// the new piece is appended, every stop string is checked, and the
/// longest safe prefix (text that CANNOT be the start of a stop string)
/// is returned for emission. Remaining tail is held until the next
/// `feed` or `flush`.
///
/// This is the same pattern as `NaiveStreamingDetokenizer` trim + hold,
/// and `ToolCallProcessor.partialMatch` — guarantees that no stop-string
/// byte is ever emitted downstream.
///
/// ## Semantics
///
/// - When any stop string is fully present in the buffer, `feed` returns
///   `.stopped(emit: prefix)` where `prefix` is the buffered text up to
///   the start of the matched stop string. The stop string itself is
///   truncated — the caller must not emit it.
/// - Otherwise `feed` returns `.streaming(emit: safePrefix)` where
///   `safePrefix` is every character that cannot be part of any stop
///   string given the current tail. The stored tail shrinks to at most
///   `maxStopLen - 1` characters.
/// - `flush()` on end-of-stream returns whatever is in the buffer (no
///   more tokens will arrive, so the tail is safe to emit).
///
/// ## Performance
///
/// `feed` is O(L · S) per call where L is the tail length (bounded by
/// `maxStopLen`) and S is the number of stop strings. For typical
/// OpenAI-compatible usage (≤4 stop strings, each ≤32 chars) this is
/// negligible relative to detokenization.
